print('Conversion de tipos')
"""
This script demonstrates type conversion (casting) in Python. It includes examples of converting between different data types such as integers, floats, strings, and booleans.
Examples:
  - Converting a string to an integer and performing arithmetic operations.
  - Converting an integer to a string and concatenating it with another string.
  - Converting a float to an integer and rounding floats to the nearest integer.
  - Evaluating the boolean value of different integers and strings.
Note:
  - The `round()` function rounds to the nearest even number when the value is exactly halfway between two integers.
  - The `bool()` function returns `False` for zero, empty strings, and `None`, and `True` for all other values.
